## What is BIGIP NEXT

![BIGIP](../posts/using-hashicorp-vault/bigip-next.jpg)

BIG-IP Next, comprising two essential components—BIG-IP Next instances and the BIG-IP Next Central Manager—delivers an all-encompassing application security and traffic management solution for applications across on-premises and multi-cloud architectures. Deployed near your apps, BIG-IP Next instances process and secure user traffic, while the BIG-IP Next Central Manager offers a unified point of control.

### BIG-IP Next Instance

The BIG-IP Next Instance is a high-performance, scalable data plane designed to deliver and secure application traffic in various environments, including on-premises, colocation facilities, cloud, and at the edge. This is achieved through seamless integration with the BIG-IP Next Central Manager, which provides a unified point of control for comprehensive application security and traffic management across multi-cloud architectures.

### BIG-IP Next Central Manager

The BIG-IP Next Central Manager serves as a centralized console that efficiently manages, automates, and monitors multiple BIG-IP Next instances, regardless of whether your applications are deployed on-premises, in colocation facilities, on the cloud, or at the edge. This seamless integration ensures comprehensive application security and traffic management across multi-cloud architectures through a unified point of control.

### What is HashiCorp Vault

HashiCorp Vault is a popular open-source tool for managing secrets and protecting sensitive data in modern infrastructure and applications. It provides a secure and centralized way to manage, store, and control access to various types of secrets, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and more. Vault is designed to address the challenges of secret management, data protection, and access control in cloud-native and dynamic environments.

### Vault PKI Secret Engine

> “The PKI secrets engine generates dynamic X.509 certificates. With this secrets engine, services can get certificates without going through the usual manual process of generating a private key and CSR, submitting to a CA, and waiting for a verification and signing process to complete. Vault’s built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms provide the verification functionality.” — [from here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/pki).

In summary, HashiCorp Vault is a powerful tool for secret management and data protection, and its PKI engine is just one of the many capabilities it offers to help organizations enhance security and manage cryptographic assets like certificates.

### Vault Agent

Vault Agent is a client daemon that provides the following features to manage the certificate life cycle. Auto-Auth — Automatically authenticate to Vault and manage the token renewal process for locally-retrieved dynamic secrets.

#### Setup Vault in your lab

1. Start Vault in a new terminal

```bash
vault server -dev -dev-root-token-id root

```

2. Export an environment variable for the vault CLI to address the Vault server.

```bash
export VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200

```

3. Export an environment variable for the vault CLI to authenticate with the Vault server.

```bash
export VAULT_TOKEN=root
```
